# Bus Tracker Exercise
## Exercise animating maps

# Bus TrackerExercise
This is an exercise where the bus stops of the number 1 bus are shown throughout Cambridege upon activation of the button. 

# Explanation
This project is a result of an assignment provided by MIT XPro. This assignment practices fundamental JavaScript skills making use of:
- Fetching data from an API. Here we use mapbox which is an opensource platform that allows us to create and display maps on the page. 
- inserting a marker on the page
- Coding logic to set a timer to move the marker through an array of co-ordinates that represent the bus stops. 
- Scheduling execution based on events on a web page

# Roadmap for Future Improvements
To elaborate on this project I would like to import co-ordinates from a server that represent an actual bus. I would like to have teh bus change color to red if it is stopped at a stop, orange if it is stopped in traffic and green of it is moving.
